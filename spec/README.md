## Frontend

The frontend is the part of the configuration that is user-interactable. It is the part that allows for configuration view and/or modification.

At its core, while a frontend is mostly imagined as a graphical user interface, it can be anything that allows for interaction with the configuration, i.e a CLI application for example.

### Frontend flow

The frontend service must be implemented with the [`enterprises.stardust.xconfig.frontend.Frontend`](../frontend/src/main/java/enterprises/stardust/xconfig/frontend/Frontend.java) 
interface and be exposed via the Java [ServiceLoader API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html).

The frontend service will utilize the backend service(s) as well as the middle-end service(s) to provide a user interface for configuration modification.

## Backend

The backend is

### Backend flow

The backend service must be implemented with the [`enterprises.stardust.xconfig.backend.Backend`](../backend/src/main/java/enterprises/stardust/xconfig/backend/Backend.java)
interface and be exposed via the Java [ServiceLoader API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html).

## Middle-end

The middle-end is the part of the configuration that is programmer-interactable. It is the part that allows for configuration declaration and (sometimes) validation.

A middle-end service can be seen as a collection of middle serializers, paired with frontend-facing instructions, such as rendering styles or dependency information.
